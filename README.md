import joblib

# Load trained model and preprocessor
model = joblib.load('models/trained_models/optimized_random_forest.pkl')
scaler = joblib.load('models/model_artifacts/feature_scaler.pkl')

# Load your customer data
new_customers = pd.read_csv('your_customer_data.csv')

# Preprocess and predict
X_scaled = scaler.transform(new_customers)
churn_predictions = model.predict(X_scaled)
churn_probabilities = model.predict_proba(X_scaled)[:, 1]

# Get risk scores
risk_scores = pd.DataFrame({
    'customer_id': new_customers.index,
    'churn_probability': churn_probabilities,
    'risk_level': ['High' if p > 0.7 else 'Medium' if p > 0.3 else 'Low' 
                   for p in churn_probabilities]
})
```
